The Odin Project

With TOP I am starting my (full stack, I hope) web developer career.
Down here I have hosted the sites I am creating through the course.

They are under Shlink, in a docker container - nginx alpine.
I am starting this journey on 15 january 2025.

I do have prior experience (knowledge, I say) in working with websites, what is a SSL and so forth.
